# Jobster

## Connecting job seekers with local businesses.

Jobster is a two-sided marketplace that connects semi-skilled job seekers with local businesses. The ecosystem includes an admin web interface to manage business accounts, job vacancies and user applications, as well as a mobile app where job seekers can find and apply for jobs. Both apps share the same Next.js backend, which is connected to a PostgreSQL database. The dominant coding language used is TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
